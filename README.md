## 🌐 Web Deployment
The project is fully configured and prepared for deployment on an **AWS EC2 instance**, including environment setup and containerization.

However, the application is **not currently running**, as the previous deployment relied on an AWS Free Tier instance, which has expired.

This means:

- The project is ready for instant redeployment on EC2.  
- All configuration files and deployment settings are already included.  
- The buyer can deploy it again in minutes by launching a new instance.  

This makes CRITIKON an excellent option for anyone looking for a **ready-to-launch Django web application with API integration**.
